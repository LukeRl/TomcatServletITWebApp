to do:

NEED TO MAKE SURE FIELDS THAT CAN BE ENTERED AND STORED IN SQL ARE UNDER THEIR SIZE LIMIT IN SQL!!~!




null pointer exception in webdispatcch line 71


text areas post an array of strings, not a single string
	needed for submitNewIssue description, comments
	ignored

Input validation for text fields
	Text areas are unvalidated but unused



Change login page alerts into page content, maybe in different colours

add remove issue button to resolved issues

lang attribute to html start tag






=======Laterish:===========




Photoshop Jim (crossed eyes error page, invert smile)

remove troubleshooty h1's from tops of jsps
	They're really only there for when we first get them displaying

Make sure labels have for="id" of their respective element - id's will need to be different between jsps, in particular the dashboard included pages









=========Later:============

	Submit issue button has it's conditions commented out
		Once we know it displays correctly, uncomment the conditions

	Write javascript where needed

	Do the css layout
		div class="tag" needs a background colour, border, padding
		table list elements should have some background colour alternation
			Also adjust input field widths
		scrollable sub-sections(done)

	Verify for character lengths in the sql:
		comment content 255
		issue description 255
		tags 15







==========Laterer:============
	Validate HTML
	Replace scriptlets with JSTL, JSP EL (expression language), bean.getAttribute
	Change KnowledgeBaseIssue to have the same formatting without needing to be in a form?
	Pretty up the css

	Photoshop Dylan on to Jim's face for secret page
	CSS self-destruct button
